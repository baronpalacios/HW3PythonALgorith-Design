# DFS Complexity Analysis
# Vertex => V Edge => E
# If your graph is implemented using adjacency lists,
# where each node maintains a list of all its adjacent edges,
# then, for each node, you could discover all its neighbors
# by traversing its adjacency list just once in linear time.
# T(n) = VO(1) + EO(1)
# T(n) = O(V) + O(E) ==> T(n) = O(V + E)
# However, In DFS, when we pass each node exactly once,
# the time complexity is at least T(n) = V*O(1) ==> T(n) = O(V).

# BFS Complexity Analysis
# The worst case (which is what O means),
# is basically for all vertices if the graph,
# do a O(1) operation with them - getting it from the queue,
# then for all outbound edges of v do another O(1) operation,
# adding their other end to the queue. Thus summing the first O(1)
# operation for all vertices gives O(V) and summing the O(outbound edge count)
# over all the vertices gives O(E), which gives O(V)+O(E)=O(V+E).
# Without the processing, or assuming it is O(1) like adding the vertex to a list.
# T(n) = O(V)+O(E) ==> T(n) = O(V+E)
