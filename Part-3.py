# This function, which determines whether
# the index value is the same as the index value in the list,
# applies the “Divide and Conquer” algorithm.
# Each time the function is called, the array is divided by two.
# Therefore, if the middle point value of this function
# is the same as the index value in the first two divisions,
# then “Best - Case” is T(n) = O(1) Constant Time.
# However, if the middle point value is not the same as the index value
# in the two segments, the “Worst - Case” T(n) = T(n/2) + c
# “Assume that, Backward Substitution Method or Forward Substitution Method is applied”
# As a result, T(n) = O(log n) is Logarithmic Time.
