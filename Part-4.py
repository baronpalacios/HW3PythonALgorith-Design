# Algorithm Analysis
# The given list is divided into two part.
# Problem is solved for each part recursively.
# At the end, the results are combined. The divide part is straightforward.
# In combine part, the sum of left and right subsets are calculated separately
# using built-in sum function at first. If the two subsets are contiguous,
# then the sum of left and right subsets calculated.
# If the sum is greater than or equal to both subset sum,
# the two subsets are merged. If the subsets are not contiguous,
# the sum of elements are calculated from beginning of the left subset to end of the right subset.
# If the range sum is greater than or equal to both subset sum, the two subsets are merged.
# If these two cases are not satisfied, then the subset that has the largest sum returned.
# The return value of this function is tuple in which includes beginning and end of the subset.

# The complexity of dividing is O(logn) since the list is divided into two part.
# The complexity of merge operation is O(n) since the sum of both side is calculated and
# the total element number is n. (I assumed that the complexity of the built-in sum function is O(n)).
# Therefore, the complexity of this problem is O(nlogn).
